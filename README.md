# IPL Dashboard

## Overview
IPL Dashboard is a Full Stack Development project that allows users to explore information about Indian Premier League (IPL) teams, including their past game details, wins, and losses ratios. The application is built using Spring Boot for the backend and React JS for the frontend.

## Features
- Browse all IPL teams
- Access past game details
- View wins and losses ratios by team and tournament year

## Technologies Used
### Backend
- `Spring Boot`: Used to develop the backend API services.
- `Spring Batch`: Employed to process data from a CSV dataset obtained from Kaggle.
- `HyperSql Database`: Utilized as the database to store and retrieve processed data.

### Frontend
- `React JS`: Used to build the user interface and manage the frontend logic.
- `Chart JS`: Integrated to visually represent wins and losses ratios with interactive charts.

## Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. run the Spring Boot application.
3. Navigate to the `frontend` folder and start the React JS application.
4. Access the application in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
